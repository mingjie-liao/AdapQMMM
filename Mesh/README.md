# Read and Write .mesh file
This part of program aims to connnect **Julia** and **FreeFem++** by reading and writing .mesh (may include g.mesh) files.

Note that we are know working with Juliav0.5.2.
## Read .mesh file
Firstly, reading .mesh file generated by **bamg**.
### Format

* The last field of each format members related to geometry (cf. square_0.mesh).

Consider the method used in /Users/Edgar/Program/Julia/CompScienceMeshes.jl-master/src/fileio, especially gmsh.jl

### Function Involved
`using StaticArrays`: to use SVector.

`open`: return an IOStream. Rememeber *close* or using 
`open(fn, "r") do io ... end`.

`|>`: apply r.h.s function to the preceding argument.

`readline`: read a single line of text.

`strip`: return string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

`parse`: parse the expression string.

`split`: return an array of substrings.

`IOBuffer(string)`: create a read-only IOBuffer.

`readdlm(source, T::Type; options...)`: The columns are assumed to be separated by one or more whitespaces. The end of line delimiter is taken as \n.

`bamg -g square_g.mesh -o square.mesh`: construct .mesh file from geometry file (_g.mesh).

### Code
struct Mesh

function read_mesh

`f = read_mesh("square.mesh")`: reads the mesh file and return a tuple containds (vertex, edge, triangle). Note that *edge* include only edges from initial geometry (square_g.mesh).

*Note* `PyPlot.triplot(x, y, tri)`, *tri* starts indexing from *0*.
