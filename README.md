# Adaptive QM/MM 
Based on the TightBonding (TB) model, we construct and solve QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics and Molecular Mechanics) coulping model. By a rigorous a poteriori error indicator, the model adaptive is carried out. Sampling strategy (e.g. $D\:{o}fler) is used to reduce computational burden.

Now the sampling depends heavily on the symmetry of problem. Mesh is constructing to take over sampling.
